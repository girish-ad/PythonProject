Each 300 mg dosage is given as one\nsubcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg.\n2.10    Preparation for Use of COSENTYX UnoReady Pen, Sensoready Pen and Prefilled Syringes  Preparation for Use of COSENTYX UnoReady Pen, Sensoready Pen and Prefilled Syringes\nCOSENTYX UnoReady pens, Sensoready pens and prefilled syringes are for subcutaneous injection only.\nBefore subcutaneous injection, remove COSENTYX from the refrigerator and allow COSENTYX to reach room\ntemperature (15 to 30 minutes for the Sensoready pen, the 150 mg/mL and 75 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringes; 30 to 45\nminutes for the UnoReady pen and the 300 mg/2 mL prefilled syringe) without removing the needle cap.\nThe removable cap of the COSENTYX 150 mg/mL Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX prefilled syringes (150 mg/mL,\n75 mg/0.5 mL) contain natural rubber latex and should not be handled by latex-sensitive individuals [see Warnings and\nPrecautions (5.6)].\nInspect COSENTYX visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. COSENTYX injection is a\nclear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles, is\ndiscolored or cloudy. Discard any unused product.\n2.11                                                                                         Preparation and Administration of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use\nCOSENTYX (for intravenous use) must be diluted prior to infusion. Using aseptic technique, prepare COSENTYX (for intravenous\nuse) as follows:\nStep 1.

In clinical trials, a higher rate of infections was observed in\nCOSENTYX treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects. In placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with\nmoderate to severe PsO, higher rates of common infections, such as nasopharyngitis (11.4% versus 8.6%), upper\nrespiratory tract infection (2.5% versus 0.7%) and mucocutaneous infections with candida (1.2% versus 0.3%) were\nobserved in subjects treated with COSENTYX compared to placebo-treated subjects. A similar increase in risk of\ninfection in subjects treated with COSENTYX was seen in placebo-controlled trials in subjects with PsA, AS and nr-\naxSpA. The incidence of some types of infections, including fungal infections, appeared to be dose-dependent in clinical\ntrials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nIn the postmarketing setting, serious bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections, and some fatal infections have\nbeen reported in patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors including COSENTYX.

COSENTYX is not recommended for use in\npatients with active viral hepatitis.\n5.2     Hypersensitivity Reactions\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria have been reported in COSENTYX\ntreated subjects in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. If an anaphylactic or\nother serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of COSENTYX and initiate appropriate\ntherapy [see Contraindications (4)].\n5.3     Pre-Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis\nEvaluate patients for active or latent TB infection prior to initiating treatment with COSENTYX. Avoid administration of\nCOSENTYX to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering COSENTYX.\nConsider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of COSENTYX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom\nan adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of active TB\nduring and after treatment.\nIn the postmarketing setting, cases were reported where patients with a history of latent tuberculosis (TB) who were\ntreated with COSENTYX developed active TB.\n5.4     Inflammatory Bowel Disease\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) exacerbations, in some cases serious and/or leading to discontinuation of\nCOSENTYX, occurred in COSENTYX treated subjects during clinical trials in PsO, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA, and HS. In adult\nsubjects with HS, the incidence of IBD was higher in subjects who received COSENTYX 300 mg every 2 weeks\n(Ulcerative Colitis [UC] 1 case, EAIR 0.2/100 subject-years; Crohn`s Disease [CD] 1 case, EAIR 0.2/100 subject-years)\ncompared to subjects who received COSENTYX 300 mg every 4 weeks (IBD 1 case, EAIR 0.2/100 subject-years). In\naddition, new onset IBD cases occurred in subjects treated with COSENTYX in clinical trials. In an exploratory trial in 59\nsubjects with active Crohn\u2019s disease [COSENTYX is not approved for the treatment of Crohn`s disease], there were\ntrends toward greater disease activity and increased adverse reactions in subjects treated with COSENTYX as compared\nto placebo-treated subjects.\nExercise caution when prescribing COSENTYX to patients with IBD. Patients treated with COSENTYX should be\nmonitored for signs and symptoms of IBD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n5.5     Eczematous Eruptions\nIn postmarketing reports, cases of severe eczematous eruptions, including atopic dermatitis-like eruptions, dyshidrotic eczema, and\nerythroderma, were reported in patients receiving COSENTYX; some cases resulted in hospitalization. The onset of eczematous\neruptions was variable, ranging from days to months after the first dose of COSENTYX.\nTreatment may need to be discontinued to resolve the eczematous eruption. Some patients were successfully treated for eczematous\neruptions while continuing COSENTYX.\n5.6     Risk of Hypersensitivity in Latex-Sensitive Individuals\nThe removable caps of the COSENTYX 150 mg/mL Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX 1 mL and 0.5 mL prefilled\nsyringes contain natural rubber latex, which may cause a hypersensitivity reaction in latex-sensitive individuals. The safe\nuse of COSENTYX 150 mg/mL Sensoready pen or 1 mL and 0.5 mL prefilled syringes in latex-sensitive individuals has\nnot been studied.\n5.7     Immunizations\nPrior to initiating therapy with COSENTYX, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to\ncurrent immunization guidelines. COSENTYX may alter a patient\u2019s immune response to live vaccines. Avoid use of live\nvaccines in patients treated with COSENTYX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\n6       ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling:",

Of the 703 patients who received COSENTYX, 299 patients received a subcutaneous loading\ndose of COSENTYX (PsA1) and 404 patients received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab (PsA2) followed by\nCOSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of\nthe trials in patients with PsA, the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was similar in the secukinumab and\nplacebo-treatment groups (59% and 58%, respectively). The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2%\nand at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16-week placebo-controlled\nperiod were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, and hypercholesterolemia. The safety\nprofile observed in adult patients with PsA treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in the PsO trials\nin adults.\nSimilar to the clinical trials in patients with PsO, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the\nCOSENTYX groups (29%) compared to placebo group (26%).\nThere were cases of CD and UC in the secukinumab group that included patients who experienced either exacerbations or\nthe development of new disease. There were three cases of IBD, of which two patients received secukinumab and one\nreceived placebo.\nAdverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with AS\nCOSENTYX was studied in two placebo-controlled AS trials with 590 adult patients (394 patients on COSENTYX and\n196 patients on placebo). Of the 394 patients who received COSENTYX, 145 patients received a subcutaneous load of\nCOSENTYX (study AS1), and 249 received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab (study AS2) followed by\nCOSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. During the 16-week placebo-controlled period of\nthe trials in patients with AS, the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was higher in the secukinumab groups\nthan the placebo-treatment groups (66% and 59%, respectively). The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at\nleast 2% and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16-week placebo-\ncontrolled period were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection. The safety profile observed in\npatients with AS treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in PsO clinical trials. In a third controlled\ntrial of AS (study AS3), the safety profile of the 300 mg dose of COSENTYX was consistent with the safety profile of the\n150 mg dose of COSENTYX.\nSimilar to clinical trials in patients with PsO, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the\nCOSENTYX groups (31%) compared to the placebo group (18%).\nIn the original AS program, with 571 patients exposed to COSENTYX, there were 8 cases of IBD during the entire\ntreatment period [5 cases of Crohn\u2019s (0.7 per 100 patient-years) and 3 cases of UC (0.4 per 100 patient-years)]. During the\nplacebo-controlled 16-week period, there were 2 Crohn\u2019s disease exacerbations and 1 new onset UC case that was a\nserious adverse event in patients treated with COSENTYX compared to none of the patients treated with placebo. During\nthe remainder of the trial when all patients received COSENTYX, 1 patient developed Crohn\u2019s disease, 2 patients had\nCrohn\u2019s exacerbations, 1 patient developed UC, and 1 patient had an UC exacerbation.\nAdverse Reactions from Clinical Trials in Adults with nr-axSpA\nCOSENTYX was studied in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled nr-axSpA trial with 555 adult patients (185\npatients received a loading COSENTYX dose, 184 patients did not receive a loading COSENTYX dose, and 186 patients\nreceived placebo). The safety profile for patients with nr-axSpA treated with COSENTYX was overall similar to the\nsafety profile seen in patients with AS and other previous experience with COSENTYX.

In a third controlled trial of AS (study AS3), the safety profile of the 300 mg dose of COSENTYX was consistent with the safety profile of the 150 mg dose of COSENTYX.\n\nSimilar to clinical trials in patients with PsO, there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups (31%) compared to the placebo group (18%).\n\nIn the original AS program, with 571 patients exposed to COSENTYX, there were 8 cases of IBD during the entire treatment period [5 cases of Crohn\u2019s (0.7 per 100 patient-years) and 3 cases of UC (0.4 per 100 patient-years)]. During the placebo-controlled 16-week period, there were 2 Crohn\u2019s disease exacerbations and 1 new onset UC case that was a serious adverse event in patients treated with COSENTYX compared to none of the patients treated with placebo. During the remainder of the trial when all patients received COSENTYX, 1 patient developed Crohn\u2019s disease, 2 patients had Crohn\u2019s exacerbations, 1 patient developed UC, and 1 patient had an UC exacerbation.",

Patients in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA\nof at least 5 years across all trials.\n  \u2022   PsA1 Study (NCT 01752634) evaluated 397 patients, who were treated with 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg of\n      COSENTYX (administered as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg) at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by the\n      same subcutaneous dose every 4 weeks. Patients who received placebo were re-randomized to receive subcutaneous\n      COSENTYX (either 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks) at Week 16 or Week 24 based on responder status. The\n      primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR20 response at Week 24.\n  \u2022   PsA2 Study (NCT 01392326) evaluated 606 patients, who were treated with intravenous secukinumab 10 mg/kg, or\n      placebo at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 75 mg or 150 mg of subcutaneous COSENTYX treatment (or\n      placebo) every 4 weeks. Patients who received placebo were re-randomized to receive subcutaneous COSENTYX\n      (either 75 mg or 150 mg every 4 weeks) at Week 16 or Week 24 based on responder status.\n  \u2022   PsA3 Study (NCT 02404350) evaluated 996 patients, who were treated with 150 mg or 300 mg of COSENTYX\n      (administered as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg) at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same\n      subcutaneous dose every 4 weeks, or once every 4 weeks of COSENTYX 150 mg. Patients treated with placebo\n      received subcutaneous COSENTYX, either 150 mg or 300 mg, per baseline randomization, at Week 16 or Week 24\n      based upon responder status. The primary endpoint was ACR20 response at Week 16 with the key secondary\n      endpoint the change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24.\nBaseline Disease Characteristics\nAt baseline, over 61% and 42% of the patients had enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively. Overall, 31% of patients\ndiscontinued previous treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 agents due to either lack of efficacy or intolerance. In addition,\napproximately 53% of patients from both studies had concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use. Patients with different\nsubtypes of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with no evidence of rheumatoid nodules (80%),\nasymmetric peripheral arthritis (63%), distal interphalangeal involvement (58%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis\n(20%), and arthritis mutilans (7%).\nClinical Response\nIn PsA1, patients treated with 150 mg or 300 mg COSENTYX demonstrated a greater clinical response, including\nACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 compared to patients treated with placebo at Week 24 (Table 7). Responses were similar in\npatients regardless of concomitant MTX treatment. Responses were seen regardless of prior anti-TNF\u03b1 exposure.\nIn patients with coexistent PsO receiving COSENTYX (n = 99), the skin lesions of psoriasis improved with treatment,\nrelative to placebo, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI).",

Patients who received placebo were re-randomized to receive subcutaneous COSENTYX (either 75 mg or 150 mg every 4 weeks) at Week 16 or Week 24 based on responder status.\n- AS3 Study (NCT02008916) evaluated 226 patients, who were treated with intravenous secukinumab 10 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo, followed by either 150 mg or 300 mg subcutaneous COSENTYX treatment every 4 weeks or placebo. Patients who received placebo were re-randomized to receive subcutaneous COSENTYX (either 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks) at Week 16. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved an ASAS20 response at Week 16. Patients were blinded to the treatment regimen up to Week 52, and the trial continued to Week 156. In this study, each 300 mg dose was administered as two injections of 150 mg.",

Patients also had to have objective signs of inflammation\nwith a C-reactive protein (CRP) level above the upper limit of normal and/or evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI).\nPatients were treated with 150 mg of subcutaneous COSENTYX treatment with a loading dosage (Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) or without\na loading dosage (Weeks 0 and 4) followed by the same dose every 4 weeks or placebo. In the double-blind period, patients (n = 555)\nreceived either placebo or COSENTYX for 52 weeks. Starting Week 16, dosage adjustment or addition of concomitant NSAIDs and\nDMARDs was permitted. Starting at Week 20, patients were allowed to switch to open-label 150 mg of subcutaneous COSENTYX\nmonthly or other biologic at the discretion of the investigator and patient. The primary endpoint was at least 40% improvement in\nAssessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS40) at Week 52.\nBaseline Disease Characteristics\nApproximately 10% and 15% of patients used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Overall, 10% of patients had received\nprevious treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 agents and discontinued these due to either lack of efficacy or intolerance.\nClinical Response\nIn nr-axSpA1 Study, treatment with COSENTYX 150 mg resulted in significant improvements in the measure of disease activity\ncompared to treatment with placebo at Week 16 and Week 52 (Table 12).",

Starting at Week 20, patients were allowed to switch to open-label 150 mg of subcutaneous COSENTYX monthly or other biologic at the discretion of the investigator and patient. The primary endpoint was at least 40% improvement in Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS40) at Week 52.\n\n# Baseline Disease Characteristics\n\nApproximately 10% and 15% of patients used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Overall, 10% of patients had received previous treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 agents and discontinued these due to either lack of efficacy or intolerance.\n\n# Clinical Response\n\nIn nr-axSpA1 Study, treatment with COSENTYX 150 mg resulted in significant improvements in the measure of disease activity compared to treatment with placebo at Week 16 and Week 52 (Table 12).",

HS Trial 1 evaluated 541 subjects and HS\nTrial 2 evaluated 543 subjects, of whom 13% and 11%, respectively, received concomitant stable dose of systemic\nantibiotics. In HS Trial 1 and HS Trial 2, 24% and 23% of patients, respectively, were previously treated with a biologic\n(biologic-exposed patients) and discontinued the biologic agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance.\nEndpoints\nThe primary endpoint in both trials was the proportion of subjects who achieved a Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response\n(HiSCR50) defined as at least a 50% decrease in abscesses and inflammatory nodules (AN) count with no increase in the number of\nabscesses and/or in the number of draining fistulae relative to baseline at Week 16.\nClinical Response\nIn HS Trial 1 and HS Trial 2, a statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg\nevery 2 weeks (after the first four weeks) achieved a HiSCR50 response at Week 16 compared to patients treated with\nplacebo (see Table 15). In both HS trials, a higher proportion of subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg every 4 weeks\n(after the first four weeks) achieved HiSCR50 at Week 16 compared to subjects treated with placebo (see Table 15),\nwhere statistical significance was reached in HS Trial 2. In both trials, the onset of action of COSENTYX occurred as\nearly as Week 2 and the efficacy progressively increased up to Week 16.\nFor the primary endpoint, HiSCR50, subjects who received any rescue medication or lesion intervention were considered\ntreatment failures and handled as non-responders (n=20 in Placebo, 11 in Q4W, and 8 in Q2W in HS Trial 1; n=23 in\nPlacebo, 17 in Q4W, and 13 in Q2W in HS Trial 2).\nImprovements were seen for the primary endpoint in HS subjects regardless of previous or concomitant antibiotic treatment or\nprevious biologic exposure.",

Your healthcare\nprovider should show you how to prepare and inject COSENTYX properly using the prefilled syringe before you use it for\nthe first time. Children should not inject COSENTYX themselves using the prefilled syringe. An adult caregiver should\nprepare and inject COSENTYX after receiving proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Talk to your healthcare\nprovider if you have any questions.\nImportant Information You Need to Know Before Injecting COSENTYX:\n\u2022   Do not use the COSENTYX prefilled syringe if either the seal on the outside carton or the seal of the blister are\n    broken. Keep the COSENTYX prefilled syringe in the sealed carton until you are ready to use it.\n\u2022   Do not use the COSENTYX prefilled syringe if the syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after\n    removing the needle cap.\n\u2022   Do not shake the COSENTYX prefilled syringe.\n\u2022   The needle cap of the prefilled syringe contains latex. Do not handle the prefilled syringe if you are sensitive\n    to latex.\n\u2022   The prefilled syringe has a needle guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the injection is finished. The\n    needle guard will help to prevent needle stick injuries to anyone who handles the prefilled syringe.\n\u2022   Do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection.\n\u2022   Avoid touching the syringe guard wings before use.

Your healthcare provider should show you how to prepare and inject COSENTYX properly using the prefilled syringe before you use it for the first time. Children should not inject COSENTYX themselves using the prefilled syringe. An adult caregiver should prepare and inject COSENTYX after receiving proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions.\n\n# Important Information You Need to Know Before Injecting COSENTYX:\n\n- Do not use the COSENTYX prefilled syringe if either the seal on the outside carton or the seal of the blister are broken. Keep the COSENTYX prefilled syringe in the sealed carton until you are ready to use it.\n- Do not use the COSENTYX prefilled syringe if the syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after removing the needle cap.\n- Do not shake the COSENTYX prefilled syringe.\n- The needle cap of the prefilled syringe contains latex. Do not handle the prefilled syringe if you are sensitive to latex.\n- The prefilled syringe has a needle guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the injection is finished. The needle guard will help to prevent needle stick injuries to anyone who handles the prefilled syringe.\n- Do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection.\n- Avoid touching the syringe guard wings before use. Touching them may cause the syringe guard to be activated too early.\n- Throw away (dispose of) the used COSENTYX prefilled syringe right away after use. Do not re-use the COSENTYX prefilled syringe.

Return the prefilled syringe and the package it came in to the pharmacy.\n7. Do not use the COSENTYX prefilled syringe if the expiration date has passed.",
